# eslint-p Â· [![npm version][npm badge]][npm URL]

A drop-in replacement for ESLint 9 featuring multithreaded parallel linting.

> **IMPORTANT:** Legacy `.eslintrc` configuration is not supported.

## Installation

```shell
npm i --save-dev eslint-p
```

```shell
yarn add --dev eslint-p
```

```shell
pnpm add --save-dev eslint-p
```

## Usage

All [ESLint CLI options](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/command-line-interface#options) are supported, plus `--concurrency` to specify the number of linting threads explicitly.

Example:

```shell
npx eslint-p --fix --concurrency=4
```

Valid values for the `--concurrency` option are:

* **positive integers (e.g. `4`)**:
  Maximum number of linting threads. The effective number of threads can be lower when linting only a few files.
* **`auto`**:
  Choose number of linting threads automatically (default).
* **`off`**:
  No multithreading, run like ESLint. This is not the same as `--concurrency=1`.

> Normally, a performance improvement **will be only noticeable on systems with 4 or more CPUs**.

## `ESLint` is installed as a dependency

This package has ESLint set as a dependency, so if you already have `eslint` installed, but with a different version than the one specified in the `package.json` of this package you might get inconsistent results between the CLI and the editor.

To check the version of `ESLint` used by this package you can use:

```shell
npx eslint-p -v
```

To avoid inconsistencies, install the same `eslint` version used by this package or remove the `eslint` dependency from your `package.json`.
